What is Mythology

Greco-Roman myths incredibly diverse
- Birth of Venus/Aphrodite
- Chronos eating his children

Myth from 'mythos': word, speech, story; but not every story is a myth

Definition Proper:
Myths are traditional tales, which maintain contact with the past and hand on inherited
wisdom to the future. Traditional tales explain a society to itself, promulgating its concers
and values. They describe patters of behviour as models for members of a society, especially
in time of crisis. - Powell
- tend to explain a society to itself, help understand society, self-identity
- historical stories can do this as well (e.g. Americans and 9/11, Pearl Harbour)

A classical myth is a story that, through its classical form, has attained a kind of immortality
because its inherent archetypal beauty, profundity, and power have inspired rewarding renewal and
transformation by successive generations. - text p25
- greco-roman myths presented in very sophisticated forms, written by talented poets


Essence of Myth
1. traditional; passed down, usually orally at first
  - Homer (700 BC) from Bronze Age -> Helen of troy from Indo-European source (before 3000 BC)
  - primitive stories like Heracles' struggles with animals/mosters from time immemorial
  - can trace different peoples through myths
2. Reconant/Useful
  - Alexander the Great: kept Iliad and a dagger under his pillow (everyday lives)
    - considered himself a decendent of Achilles
  - broadly and profoundly resonant (Sophocles Oedipus)
  - explains national identity (Theseus recceiving Oedipus)
    - Oedipus originally continued on as a King of Thebes
    - Sophocles rewrote Oedipus ends up dying in Athenian territory (accepted by Athenians)
      - figure of blessing/luck rather than a curse
3. Flexible/Adaptable
  - Athenian tragic poets take traditional epic (Homeric) stories and transform them (e.g. Oedipus)
    - Athenians didn't like Thebes... changed Thebeian myth to Athenian myth
  - Contemporary 'myths' e.g. Spiderman, The Amazons (Wonder Woman)
    - spiderman (radioactive in 60s, genetically modified spider now)
    - Greeks were patriarchal, wrote stories of defeating Amazons (matriarchal cultural threat)

Myth and Truth
1. Ancient Times:
- as long as myths are valuable or at least interesting?
- Xenophanes (fl. 540 BC): criticized the anthropomorphism of Greek gods
  - one god is greatest among gods and men, but his appearance and thought are nothing like ours
  - gods appearances usually reflect the civilization (he said that's stupid)
- Plato: criticized shameful actions of the gods and that myth appealed to the passions, not reason
- Aristotle (different): myth was more philosophical than history; myth + philosophy related
