#What is Mythology

##Greco-Roman myths incredibly diverse
- Birth of Venus/Aphrodite
- Chronos eating his children

Myth from 'mythos': word, speech, story; but not every story is a myth

#Definition
===========

##Definition Proper:
Myths are traditional tales, which maintain contact with the past and hand on inherited
wisdom to the future. Traditional tales explain a society to itself, promulgating its concers
and values. They describe patters of behviour as models for members of a society, especially
in time of crisis. - Powell
- tend to explain a society to itself, help understand society, self-identity
- historical stories can do this as well (e.g. Americans and 9/11, Pearl Harbour)

A classical myth is a story that, through its classical form, has attained a kind of immortality
because its inherent archetypal beauty, profundity, and power have inspired rewarding renewal and
transformation by successive generations. - text p25
- greco-roman myths presented in very sophisticated forms, written by talented poets


#Essence of Myth
##1. traditional; passed down, usually orally at first
  - Homer (700 BC) from Bronze Age -> Helen of troy from Indo-European source (before 3000 BC)
  - primitive stories like Heracles' struggles with animals/mosters from time immemorial
  - can trace different peoples through myths
##2. Reconant/Useful
  - Alexander the Great: kept Iliad and a dagger under his pillow (everyday lives)
    - considered himself a decendent of Achilles
  - broadly and profoundly resonant (Sophocles Oedipus)
  - explains national identity (Theseus recceiving Oedipus)
    - Oedipus originally continued on as a King of Thebes
    - Sophocles rewrote Oedipus ends up dying in Athenian territory (accepted by Athenians)
      - figure of blessing/luck rather than a curse
##3. Flexible/Adaptable
  - Athenian tragic poets take traditional epic (Homeric) stories and transform them (e.g. Oedipus)
    - Athenians didn't like Thebes... changed Thebeian myth to Athenian myth
  - Contemporary 'myths' e.g. Spiderman, The Amazons (Wonder Woman)
    - spiderman (radioactive in 60s, genetically modified spider now)
    - Greeks were patriarchal, wrote stories of defeating Amazons (matriarchal cultural threat)

#Myth and Truth
##1. Ancient Times:
- as long as myths are valuable or at least interesting?
- Xenophanes (fl. 540 BC): criticized the anthropomorphism of Greek gods
  - one god is greatest among gods and men, but his appearance and thought are nothing like ours
  - gods appearances usually reflect the civilization (he said that's stupid)
- Plato: criticized shameful actions of the gods and that myth appealed to the passions, not reason
- Aristotle (different): myth was more philosophical than history; myth + philosophy related
##2. Today: scientific and historical facts are highly valued; can myth embody truth?




#Interpretation
================

##Ancient:
- with initial scepticism came question: to reject (like Plato), or allegorize?
###1. Physical Allegory:
in response to the natural philosophers and Xenophanes
e.g. Theagenes of Rhegiu,: strife of gods = strife of elements in natural world
- clashing of opposite natural forces (hot/cold, light/dark, Greeks/Trojans) pushes world
  in different forces
- meaningful allegory for the world

###2. Historical Allegory
e.g. Euhemerus: gods are powerful ancient kings whose stories were exaggerated
- Hesiod's creation story (Uranus, Cronus, Zeus); rationalized to royal family struggle

###3. Moral Allegory
e.g.
- Daphne (virtues of chastity; Apollo chases her) prays to river god to save her, 
  turned into a tree; allegory for pursuit of chastity
- Judgement of Paris (choice of active, contemplative, of appetitive life) every man 
  must choose what life he will live:
  - Hera = active, political life
  - Athena = contemplative, academic, religious life
  - Aphrodite = appetitive, pursue desires/lusts

##Medieval: myth preserved in sparse handbooks of moral "allegory"
- mostly simple, allegorical use to 'explain them away'
- some use in Dante's inferno

##Renaissance (ca. 1400-1650)
elaborate sophisticated moral allegory based on actual ancient texts (greek/latin) from
the fall of Constantinople
- allegorical approach of significant truths

##Enlightenment (1650+)
rationalistic denigration of myth as "primitive"
but Cf. Romantic reaction: myts embody primal truth about nature and the human soul
- humans have a mystical/spiritual element, should not give it up (romanticism)



##Modern:
###1. Psychological
**Freud**: myths are similar to dreams and help us to work through repressed wishes and 
fears e.g. Oedipus complex

**Jung**: myths express universal human experience based on the collective unconscious
not just personal psychology
- archetypes: characters (e.g. wise old man, trickster)
- narrrative patters (e.g. hero's quest) NB: Joseph Campbell
- criticism: this homogenizes mythology too much

###2. Anthropological
Ritual (**J.G. Frazer**): myth is religious ritual in story form e.g. Adonis
- ritual of death of king --> fertility

Social Charter (**B. Malinowski**): myths justify social practices e.g. Prometheus
and sacrificial offerings (offering of bad under good surface, good under bad surface)

###3. Structural: not details but patterns
a) **C. Levi-Strauss**: myths reflect binary nature of human psyche e.g. living person 
   descent to the underworld
b) **V. Propp**: myths have recurring patterns (russian folk tales)
c) **W. Berkert**: used structural and anthropological approach but accounted for 
   complexities by recognizing changing societies produce variations of myth

###4. Feminist: myths reflect a patriarchal and misogynistic culture which eclipses 
original foundational Mother Earth worldview
e.g. Zeus and Europa, but compare Aphrodite and Anchises
- Anchises = mortal, Aphrodite falls in love with him
  - Zeus pissed off at Aphrodite, he's always lusting after mortals, but always feels 
    guilty about being immortal falling for mortals
  - Aphrodite comes in disguise, sleeps with Anchises; terrified when he finds out he
    slept with a goddess; reversal: male overpowered by goddess
